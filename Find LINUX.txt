Find command – examples using mtime


Fractional 24-hour periods are truncated! That means that “find -mtime +1” says to match files modified two or more days ago.

find . -mtime +0 # find files modified greater than 24 hours ago
find . -mtime 0 # find files modified between now and 1 day ago
# (i.e., in the past 24 hours only)
find . -mtime -1 # find files modified less than 1 day ago (SAME AS -mtime 0)
find . -mtime 1 # find files modified between 24 and 48 hours ago
find . -mtime +1 # find files modified more than 48 hours ago

The following may only work on GNU?
find . -mmin +5 -mmin -10 # find files modified between
# 6 and 9 minutes ago
find / -mmin -10 # modified less than 10 minutes ago
